# 🔢 LinearAlgebra

**LinearAlgebra** is a custom C++ library that provides the fundamental building blocks for matrix and vector operations. It is designed for educational purposes and to support projects like neural networks and machine learning implementations.

---

## 🧩 Overview

LinearAlgebra is a lightweight, self-contained library offering essential operations on vectors and matrices.  
It can be used independently or as a foundation for other projects, such as **[ARNetwork](https://github.com/nojia1775/ARNetwork)** or **[ft_linear_regression](https://github.com/nojia1775/ft_linear_regression)**.

The library aims to give full control over low-level mathematical operations while being easy to understand and extend.
